# HDB-price-prediction
# This project explores different machine learning models to predict HDB resale prices. Three modeling techniques were evaluated:
  Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
  Decision Tree
  Random Forest
# Factors Influencing HDB Prices
To build an effective regression model, we identified four key categories of factors that impact HDB prices:

Physical Conditions – Direct attributes affecting price (e.g., age, floor level, size).
Proximity to Surrounding Amenities – Geolocation-based influence of nearby facilities (e.g., schools, malls, parks).
Proximity to Transportation – Accessibility to MRT stations and bus stops.
Sentiment Indexes of Surrounding Amenities – Text analysis of online reviews and discussions to gauge sentiment toward nearby amenities.
This project aims to analyze and compare these models to determine the most effective approach for predicting HDB prices.
